# What is an Engineer Letter?

An **Engineer Letter** (also known as a "PE Letter," "Stamped Letter," or "Letter of Certification") is an official document written and signed by a licensed Professional Engineer (PE).

At its core, the letter is a professional's expert opinion, put in writing. It certifies that a specific aspect of a construction project, a design plan, or an existing structure has been reviewed and found to comply with relevant building codes, safety standards, and sound engineering principles.

### What is its Purpose?

Think of it as a stamp of approval from a qualified expert. Its primary purposes are to:

1.  **Assure a Building Department:** It provides a city or county building official with the verification they need to approve a permit or close out an inspection. The engineer is essentially telling the official, "I have reviewed this, and it is safe and compliant."
2.  **Verify Structural Integrity:** For projects involving loads, foundations, or modifications to a building's frame, the letter confirms that the design is structurally sound.
3.  **Solve Specific Problems:** Sometimes, a project has a unique or non-standard element that isn't covered by prescriptive code. An engineer's letter can provide a custom-designed solution and the justification for it.
4.  **Provide Legal and Insurance Documentation:** The letter serves as formal documentation that due diligence was performed, which can be critical for insurance purposes or if legal questions arise later.

### Who Typically Requests It?
- Homeowners applying for permits
- Contractors dealing with code corrections
- Architects and designers validating non-prescriptive elements
- Realtors or insurance agents needing structural verification

### What It's Not

* **It's not a full set of blueprints.** An engineer letter is typically a 1-3 page document focused on a *specific issue*. It is delivered as a digitally signed and sealed PDF, ready for submission.
* **It's not a simple inspection report.** While an inspection is part of the process, the letter goes a step further by providing a professional certification and bearing the engineer's legal and professional responsibility.

In short, an engineer letter is the tool used to provide clarity, confidence, and compliance for specific parts of a building project.
