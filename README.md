# Engineer Letter Library

A conservative, open-source framework for structuring **engineering letter artifacts** and **LLM instruction workflows**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository does **not** provide engineering advice, code interpretation, or final engineering determinations.
> All final conclusions, certifications, and stamped deliverables must be made by a licensed Professional Engineer (PE) with authority in the relevant jurisdiction.

## Purpose (Phase 1: Scaffolding)

This phase establishes a durable architecture so future contributors can add:
- Letter templates (language structure only)
- Reusable instruction primitives
- Scenario/situation modules
- Prompt blueprints for LLM-assisted drafting support

This phase intentionally excludes final opinion language, engineering calculations, and compliance determinations.

## Orientation Documents

- `what-is-an-engineer-letter.md`: concise definition and repository boundary framing.
- `docs/architecture/engineer-letter-faq.md`: practical FAQ for contributors and users.
- `docs/architecture/repository-map.md`: map of repository responsibilities and folder intent.
- `docs/review/current-state-review.md`: practical assessment and near-term improvement plan.
- `docs/workflows/letter-corpus-intake-and-skill-packaging.md`: step-by-step process for sanitizing private letters, synthesizing categories/tips, and packaging a reusable skill.
- `docs/governance/data-sanitization-policy.md`: de-identification rules for source-derived content.

## Design Principles

1. **PE authority is non-delegable**
   - LLM outputs are drafting aids only.
2. **Conservative legal posture**
   - Avoid definitive compliance claims in reusable scaffolds.
3. **Composable building blocks**
   - Separate template structure, scenario context, and instruction logic.
4. **Parameter-first authoring**
   - Letters are assembled from validated parameters, not ad-hoc prose.
5. **Traceability and reviewability**
   - Inputs, assumptions, and limitations are explicit and reviewable.

## Parameterization Model (Core)

Future letters should be defined by explicit parameters (non-exhaustive):
- `jurisdiction`: state/province/local authority context
- `discipline`: structural/civil/geotechnical/etc.
- `letter_type`: observation summary, deferred submittal support, etc.
- `project_metadata`: project name, address, permit reference
- `inspection_context`: date, method, observed areas, access limits
- `scope_of_review`: what is and is not included
- `assumptions`: declared assumptions used in draft language
- `limitations`: constraints, exclusions, and data limitations
- `requested_by`: party requesting the document
- `pe_reviewer`: responsible engineer metadata (placeholder only)

See `schemas/letter-parameters/` for scaffold files.

## Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase kebab-case for file and folder names.
- Keep scenario modules short, specific, and reusable.
- Keep template files content-neutral and section-oriented.
- Prefer `.md` for instruction documents and `.yaml` for structured parameter examples.

## External Guide Intake (e.g., Lee County, Florida)

Yes—external guides can be loaded as **reference metadata** under `data/references/` using source manifests.

Use this flow:
1. Add source metadata YAML (URL, publisher, jurisdiction, date, license status).
2. Keep full-text storage disabled unless permissions are explicitly documented.
3. Run PE/legal review before converting insights into reusable scaffolding.

## How This Repository Evolves

When real-world training letters are added later:
1. Place source corpora under `data/training/` with provenance metadata.
2. Extract recurring structural patterns into `templates/`.
3. Extract reusable logic and caveat language into `instructions/primitives/`.
4. Add scenario-specific context packs under `scenarios/modules/`.
5. Update prompt blueprints to orchestrate retrieval + parameter validation + boundary checks.

## Current Status

This repository now includes baseline scaffolding across architecture, governance, safety guardrails, prompts, schemas, scenarios, and template placeholders.

It is prepared for phased population with curated source material, provenance metadata, and PE-supervised workflows.
